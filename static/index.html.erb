        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>
            This CTF is powered by <a href="https://github.com/drahosj/unctfd">
            UnCTFd</a>, an uncomplicated CTF engine with philosophical
            differences from other software commonly used for this purpose. The
            primary interface is a BBS-like interactive text interface, but a
            <a href="/scoreboard.html">HTML scoreboard</a> is provided for your
            convenience.
        </p>
        <h2>Accessing UnCTFD</h2>
        <p>
            UnCTFd can be accessed on port 1337 (cleartext) or port 2222 (SSH,
            requires registration). SSH is recommended for flag submissions,
            especially over a wireless internet connection. Connection command 
            examples are shown below.
        </p>
        <h4>Cleartext</h4>
        <code>nc <%= ENV['CTF_HOST'] %> 1337</code>
        <h4>SSH</h4>
        <code>ssh -p 2222 bbs@<%= ENV['CTF_HOST'] %></code>
        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
            Initial registration must be performed over cleartext. You will be
            prompted to choose a team name and password (team name regex:
            <code>^[a-z0-9_\-'â˜ƒ ]{1,30}$</code>). You also have the option of
            adding an SSH key at registration time (additional keys can be added
            at any time by logging in).
        </p>
        <h2>Joining a Team</h2>
        <p>
            The easiest way to join a teams is to connect over cleartext, log in
            with the password, and add your SSH key to the team.
        </p>
        <h2>Flags</h2>
        <p>
            Each challenge will have one or more flags. Flags are in the format 
            <code><%=ENV['FLAG_PREFIX']%>{some_text_here}</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice good sportsmanship. Do not DoS online services or
                    delete flags once obtained.</li>
                <li>Do not attack other teams.</li>
                <li>Avoid exploiting the CTF infrastructure in a manner that
                    damages the integrity of the competition (such as leaking
                    flags).</li>
            </ul>
